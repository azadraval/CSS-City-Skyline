# City Skyline Project

This is my City Skyline project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built an animated cityscape that transitions between day and night modes using CSS variables.

## Project Overview

The City Skyline project challenged me to create a detailed urban landscape using pure CSS. The skyline features multiple buildings with windows that light up, demonstrating advanced CSS techniques and responsive design.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Using CSS variables for dynamic styling
- Creating complex layouts with CSS positioning
- Implementing color gradients for sky effects
- Building geometric shapes purely with CSS
- Using media queries to create responsive designs
- Organizing CSS with class naming conventions
- Creating a day/night mode transition effect
- Implementing repeating elements efficiently

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with variables and media queries)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML structure for the skyline
- `styles.css` - The comprehensive CSS styling that creates the visual effects

## Design Elements

The skyline features:
- A dynamic background that changes between day and night
- Foreground and background building layers for depth
- Detailed window patterns on the buildings
- Color transitions based on screen width
- Carefully positioned elements to create a realistic city silhouette

This project really pushed my CSS skills to the next level, teaching me how CSS variables can create dynamic visual experiences and how positioning can create complex layouts without using images.
